<h2>Ruber 0.0.9</h2>
<h3>Features</h3>
<h2>Ruber 0.0.9</h2>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
	<li>It is now possible to have more than one open project at the same time</li>
	<li>When a project is active, only the editors associated with it are visibile</li>
	<li>Editors not associated with a project are visible only when there&#8217;s no active
  project</li>
	<li>Made the Auto End plugin recognize some other keywords: <code>unless</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>,
  <code>until</code> (the last two were already recognized when followed by a <code>do</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The RSpec plugin now correctly displays pending examples</li>
	<li>Fixed a crash when creating a new document and saving it as a ruby file while
  using the Syntax Checker plugin</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ruber 0.0.8</h2>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a new plugin: Auto End. As the name says, it automatically inserts <code>end</code>
  keywords after <code>module</code>, <code>class</code>, <code>if</code>&#8230; Its implementation is a bit naive at
  the moment (in particular, it doesn&#8217;t know whether the current line is in the
  middle of a string or of a block comment), so it can insert <code>end</code> in the wrong
  places. If it does, just Undo the last action and the end&#8217;ll go away</li>
	<li>Changed the way you open a file in the editor from a tool widget without closing
  the tool widget itself. Now there&#8217;s a little button on the right of the tool
  widget with a pin on it. Clicking on it prevents the widget being closed when
  clicking on a file name. This change was made because the Meta key is now used
  for something else</li>
	<li>When clicking on a file name while keeping the Meta key pressed, a new editor
  for the file is open (even if there was already one open). The new editor can
  be opened by splitting the current editor or in a new tab, depending on an
  option chosen by the user</li>
	<li>The RSpec tool widget now displays an horizontal scroll bar if a failure description
  is too long to fit on the tool widget. Unfortunately, I haven&#8217;t as yet found
  out how to do the same for the example descriptions</li>
	<li>Replaced Switch to File and Switch to Spec menu entries in the Ruby/Test menu
  with a single menu entry, which changes its name and behaviour depending on
  whether the current file is a spec file or not</li>
	<li>Added an option allowing to choose whether switching from spec file to code file
  (and the other way round) should be done by opening another tab or splitting
  the current editor</li>
	<li>Added a widget to display the output in the Command plugin. The widget is hidden
  by default and can be shown using a button</li>
	<li>Added menu entries (with the corresponding shortcuts) to move between split views
  in the current pane</li>
	<li>Disabled autoscrolling in tool widgets if the scroll bar is not at the end. This
  way, the user can look at a particular piece of output while other lines are
  appended at the end. This behaviour is the same used, for example, by Konsole</li>
</ul>
<h3>Minor changes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Scrolling on an editor using the mouse wheel gives focus to the editor</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Restored the Close Current Tab menu entry, which disappeared during the previous
  round of changes to ruberui.rc</li>
	<li>Do not attempt to require <code>kio</code> if using <span class="caps">KDE</span> 4.4. <code>kio.rb</code> was split from
  <code>korundum4.rb</code> in <span class="caps">KDE</span> 4.5, so requiring it in <span class="caps">KDE</span> 4.4 fails</li>
	<li>When an exception is raised while executing code from the Command plugin, display
  an OK button, rather than a Quit Ruber button, since pressing the button will
  not (and should not) quit Ruber</li>
	<li>Fixed a crash involved nested split views</li>
	<li>Fixed a crash happening every time you tried to customize shortcuts after closing
  a document (which meant always if you use the State plugin). The problem was
  was caused by the Window/Switch to Document submenu being updated incorrectly
  when a document was closed</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ruber 0.0.7</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Ability to split views in tabs</li>
	<li>Ability to have more than one view for each document</li>
	<li>Made the terminal program used to run ruby programs configurable</li>
	<li>Added (optional) close buttons on tabs</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ruber 0.0.6</h2>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Allow Ruber to work with remote files</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug causing a crash from the Choose Plugins dialog in case of an error</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug causing Ruber to look for plugins in the directory installation of
  a previous version if the plugin directories settings had been changed (even if
  the default directory hadn&#8217;t been changed)</li>
	<li>Made the rake plugin depend on the autosave plugin</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ruber 0.0.5</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug causing an error when opening files</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ruber 0.0.4</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug causing Ruber to fail starting up if the <code>$KDEHOME/share/apps/ruber/plugins</code>
  directory was missing</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug preventing new documents being created</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ruber 0.0.3</h2>
<p>Version skipped for technical reasons</p>
<h2>Ruber 0.0.2</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug causing Ruber to fail starting up if the <code>$KDEHOME/share/apps/ruber/</code>
  directory was missing</li>
</ul></div></div>
