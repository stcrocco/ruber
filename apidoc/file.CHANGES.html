<h2>Ruber 0.0.10</h2>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a RI plugin. You can now insert the class or method name in the RI tool widget
  and see the documentation in a nice <span class="caps">HTML</span> format inside the tool widget itself.
  This plugin requires RDoc version 3.x (it isn&#8217;t tested with version 2.x).</li>
	<li>Added an <span class="caps">IRB</span> plugin</li>
	<li>The syntax checker plugin has been rewritten. Now other plugins can check the
  syntax of a document</li>
	<li>Ruby and <span class="caps">YAML</span> syntax checker now are in their own plugin, rather than being part
  of the syntax checker plugin</li>
	<li>The auto end plugin doesn&#8217;t use indentation anymore to decide whether the end keyword
  should be inserted or not. Instead, it performs a syntax check and only inserts
  end if ruby reports a missing end keyword. This should improve the accuracy of
  the plugin</li>
	<li>The Auto End plugin now inserts the <code>end</code> keyword after a <code>case</code> expression</li>
	<li>Clicking on a file name in an output widget with the middle mouse button now
  prevents the tool widget from being hidden, as if the pin button were clicked</li>
	<li>Changed the interface to specify patterns in the RSpec plugin</li>
	<li>The RSpec plugin now supports specs inside subdirectories. You can also specify
  subdirectories inside the pattern to match code file and the respective spec
  file</li>
	<li>When choosing the Run Specs for Current File action in the RSpec plugin, if the current
  document is associated with a code file, all the specs associated with it are
  run (previously, only one of them was run)</li>
	<li>When choosing the Run Current Spec action in the RSpec plugin, if the current
  document is a code file, the plugin will look at the most recently activated
  editor containing a spec file for the current file to determine which is the
  current spec.</li>
	<li>The behaviour of output widgets when clicking on a file name which requires
  opening a new editor has changed. The choice made by the user to open the editor
  in the current tab by splitting the current editor is ignored if the current 
  tab already contains more than one editor. The reason is that usually there
  won&#8217;t be enough space on the sceen to comfortably accomodate more than two
  editors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Do not crash when closing with unsaved files</li>
	<li>Horizontal scrollbar in the RSpec tool widget will be displayed when the spec
  description is larger than the widget but the rest of the text isn&#8217;t</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ruber 0.0.9</h2>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
	<li>It is now possible to have more than one open project at the same time</li>
	<li>When a project is active, only the editors associated with it are visibile</li>
	<li>Editors not associated with a project are visible only when there&#8217;s no active
  project</li>
	<li>Made the Auto End plugin recognize some other keywords: <code>unless</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>,
  <code>until</code> (the last two were already recognized when followed by a <code>do</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The RSpec plugin now correctly displays pending examples</li>
	<li>Fixed a crash when creating a new document and saving it as a ruby file while
  using the Syntax Checker plugin</li>
	<li>When clicking on a file name in an output widget, give focus to the editor instead
  of keeping it in  the tool widget</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ruber 0.0.8</h2>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a new plugin: Auto End. As the name says, it automatically inserts <code>end</code>
  keywords after <code>module</code>, <code>class</code>, <code>if</code>&#8230; Its implementation is a bit naive at
  the moment (in particular, it doesn&#8217;t know whether the current line is in the
  middle of a string or of a block comment), so it can insert <code>end</code> in the wrong
  places. If it does, just Undo the last action and the end&#8217;ll go away</li>
	<li>Changed the way you open a file in the editor from a tool widget without closing
  the tool widget itself. Now there&#8217;s a little button on the right of the tool
  widget with a pin on it. Clicking on it prevents the widget being closed when
  clicking on a file name. This change was made because the Meta key is now used
  for something else</li>
	<li>When clicking on a file name while keeping the Meta key pressed, a new editor
  for the file is open (even if there was already one open). The new editor can
  be opened by splitting the current editor or in a new tab, depending on an
  option chosen by the user</li>
	<li>The RSpec tool widget now displays an horizontal scroll bar if a failure description
  is too long to fit on the tool widget. Unfortunately, I haven&#8217;t as yet found
  out how to do the same for the example descriptions</li>
	<li>Replaced Switch to File and Switch to Spec menu entries in the Ruby/Test menu
  with a single menu entry, which changes its name and behaviour depending on
  whether the current file is a spec file or not</li>
	<li>Added an option allowing to choose whether switching from spec file to code file
  (and the other way round) should be done by opening another tab or splitting
  the current editor</li>
	<li>Added a widget to display the output in the Command plugin. The widget is hidden
  by default and can be shown using a button</li>
	<li>Added menu entries (with the corresponding shortcuts) to move between split views
  in the current pane</li>
	<li>Disabled autoscrolling in tool widgets if the scroll bar is not at the end. This
  way, the user can look at a particular piece of output while other lines are
  appended at the end. This behaviour is the same used, for example, by Konsole</li>
</ul>
<h3>Minor changes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Scrolling on an editor using the mouse wheel gives focus to the editor</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Restored the Close Current Tab menu entry, which disappeared during the previous
  round of changes to ruberui.rc</li>
	<li>Do not attempt to require <code>kio</code> if using <span class="caps">KDE</span> 4.4. <code>kio.rb</code> was split from
  <code>korundum4.rb</code> in <span class="caps">KDE</span> 4.5, so requiring it in <span class="caps">KDE</span> 4.4 fails</li>
	<li>When an exception is raised while executing code from the Command plugin, display
  an OK button, rather than a Quit Ruber button, since pressing the button will
  not (and should not) quit Ruber</li>
	<li>Fixed a crash involved nested split views</li>
	<li>Fixed a crash happening every time you tried to customize shortcuts after closing
  a document (which meant always if you use the State plugin). The problem was
  was caused by the Window/Switch to Document submenu being updated incorrectly
  when a document was closed</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ruber 0.0.7</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Ability to split views in tabs</li>
	<li>Ability to have more than one view for each document</li>
	<li>Made the terminal program used to run ruby programs configurable</li>
	<li>Added (optional) close buttons on tabs</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ruber 0.0.6</h2>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Allow Ruber to work with remote files</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug causing a crash from the Choose Plugins dialog in case of an error</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug causing Ruber to look for plugins in the directory installation of
  a previous version if the plugin directories settings had been changed (even if
  the default directory hadn&#8217;t been changed)</li>
	<li>Made the rake plugin depend on the autosave plugin</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ruber 0.0.5</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug causing an error when opening files</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ruber 0.0.4</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug causing Ruber to fail starting up if the <code>$KDEHOME/share/apps/ruber/plugins</code>
  directory was missing</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug preventing new documents being created</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ruber 0.0.3</h2>
<p>Version skipped for technical reasons</p>
<h2>Ruber 0.0.2</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug causing Ruber to fail starting up if the <code>$KDEHOME/share/apps/ruber/</code>
  directory was missing</li>
</ul></div></div>
