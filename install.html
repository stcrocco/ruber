        <h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>To run Ruber, you need to have the following installed</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ruby 1.8.7 <span class="caps">MRI</span> or later (<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">www.ruby-lang.org</a>). Ruber
  works with both ruby 1.8.7 and ruby 1.9.x</li>
	<li>Korundum (<span class="caps">KDE</span> Ruby bindings) version 4.5.2 or later (<a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/korundum/">rubyforge.org/projects/korundum</a>).
  Version 4.5.0 and 4.5.1 will likely not work, while the 4.4 releases
  may or may not work (some bugs have been fixed since these versions, so earlier
  versions may lead to crashes).</li>
	<li>The Facets gem (<a href="http://rubyworks.github.com/facets">rubyworks.github.com/facets/</a>),
  version 2.7 or later</li>
	<li>The Dictionary gem (<a href="http://death.rubyforge.org/dictionary/">death.rubyforge.org/dictionary</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plugin dependencies</h2>
<p>Some plugins need external libraries and/or programs to work. If you don&#8217;t have
these requirements, then some of the plugins won&#8217;t work. Ruber itself and the
other plugins will still work correctly, however. The programs needed by the plugins
are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>rak (<a href="http://rak.rubyforge.org/">rak.rubyforge.org</a>), needed by the Find in Files plugin</li>
	<li>rake (<a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">rake.rubyforge.org</a>), needed by the Rake plugin (already included in ruby 1.9.x)</li>
	<li>rspec, either the <a href="http://rspec.info/">1.x series</a> or the <a href="github.com/rspec/rspec/wiki">2.x series</a>, needed by the RSpec plugin</li>
	<li>rdoc (<a href="https://github.com/rdoc/rdoc">https://github.com/rdoc/rdoc</a>), needed by
    the RI plugin. RDoc is included in both ruby 1.8.7 and ruby 1.9.x, but the
    version shipped with ruby 1.8.7 isn&#8217;t supported by the plugin. If you want to
    use it with ruby 1.8.7, you&#8217;ll have to install a new version.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installing Ruber and its dependencies</h2>
<h3>The easy way</h3>
<p>This is the recommanded way to install Ruber, and, if possible, you should always
used this method. It makes use of the package manager provided by your distribution
to install most of the required libraries, and uses rubygems to install Ruber and
the gems which aren&#8217;t availlable as packages for your distribution. This is what
you need to do:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Install Ruby (and rubygems, if using ruby 1.8.7) using your package manager</li>
	<li>Install the <span class="caps">KDE</span> Ruby bindings using your package manager (usually, the name of the package
  will be something like <code>korundum</code>, <code>korundum4</code> or <code>kdebindings-ruby</code>). Depending
  on the packages you have already installed on your system, other packages
  may also be installed.</li>
	<li>Install Facets and Dictionary using your package manager. You can skip this step
  if you want: these libraries will be installed as gems in the following step.</li>
	<li>Install Ruber using rubygems (this will also install any gem Ruber depends upon):
  <span class="shell">gem install ruber</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>The hard way</h3>
<p>The hard way to install ruber is to install the needed dependencies by hand. In particular
(depending on what you have already installed) this may mean installing ruby, the <span class="caps">KDE</span>
libraries and the <span class="caps">KDE</span> Ruby bindings. If you want, you can also mix the easy and
the hard way, installing some of the above programs using your package manager and
some other by hand.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> installing the hard way is much more difficult than using the easy way,
so you&#8217;re advised not to use this method, unless absolutely needed (that is, if
the easy method doesn&#8217;t work for some reason which can&#8217;t be fixed).</p>
<h4>Installing Ruby by hand</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Download ruby from <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">the Ruby home page</a></li>
	<li>Unpack the tarball</li>
	<li><span class="shell">cd</span> in the directory created by unpacking the tarball</li>
	<li>Run <span class="shell">./configure</span>, passing it any argument you want. In particular, you may want
  to change the installation directory (which by default is <code>/usr/local</code>) and
  add a prefix or suffix to the executable name (this is useful if you want two)
  versions of ruby installed at the same time. To change the installation directory,
  pass the <code>--prefix DIR</code> argument to configure, where <code>DIR</code> is the directory you
  want to install ruby into. To add a prefix or a suffix to the executables, use
  the <code>--program-prefix</code> or <code>--program-suffix</code> options, followed by the prefix or
  suffix you want. Use <span class="shell">./configure <code>--</code>help</span> to see all the options accepted by
  <code>configure</code></li>
	<li>Run <span class="shell">make</span></li>
	<li>Run <span class="shell">make install</span>. Unless you changed the installation directory to a directory
  you have write access to, this command must be run as superuser.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Installing the <span class="caps">KDE</span> libraries by hand</h4>
<p>I strongly discourage from building the <span class="caps">KDE</span> libraries by hand, given the large
number of dependencies they have and the fact that every distribution has packages
for them. To install using a package manager, simply install the <code>kdelibs</code> package.</p>
<p>If you really want to install by hand, here&#8217;s what to do</p>
<ul>
	<li>Install the needed dependencies. They&#8217;re listed on the <a href="http://techbase.kde.org/Build_requirements"><span class="caps">KDE</span> techbase site</a>,
  with instructions for different distributions. However, not all the dependencies
  listed here are required to install Ruber. You can try skipping this section for
  now and return to it after running cmake (see below).</li>
	<li>Download the <span class="caps">KDE</span> libraries from the <a href="http://www.kde.org/download"><span class="caps">KDE</span> home page</a>.
  Choose the version marked as <em>recommended for end users</em>, then, following the
  link, download the <code>kdelibs</code> tarball. Do not follow the instructions linked on
  the download page, as they&#8217;re for people developing <span class="caps">KDE</span> itself</li>
	<li>Unpack the tarball</li>
	<li><span class="shell">cd</span> in the directory created unpacking the tarball</li>
	<li>Create a build directory: <span class="shell">mkdir build</span></li>
	<li><span class="shell">cd build</span></li>
	<li><span class="shell">cmake ..</span> This will fail if you&#8217;re missing a required library. In this case,
  it&#8217;ll tell you which it is and you&#8217;ll be able to install it</li>
	<li>Run <span class="shell">ccmake .</span> This will give you a pseudo-graphical interface where to set
  some options. In particular, look at the <code>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</code> option, which controls
  the directory <span class="caps">KDE</span> will be installed into, and change it as you like. After changing
  the options you need, press <code>c</code> to configure and <code>g</code> to generate. Then <code>e</code> to
  exit</li>
	<li><span class="shell">make</span></li>
	<li><span class="shell">make install</span>. Unless you changed the installation directory to a directory
  you have write access to, this command must be run as superuser.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Installing the <span class="caps">KDE</span> Ruby bindings</h4>
<p>First, Make sure you have both the Ruby and <span class="caps">KDE</span> headers installed. If you installed 
Ruby or the <span class="caps">KDE</span> libraries using the package manager, depending on your distribution, 
you may not have installed the header files needed by the compiler. Using your
package manager, see if there are packages called something like <code>ruby-devel</code>
and <code>kdelibs-devel</code> (or <code>ruby-headers</code> and <code>kdelibs-headers</code>). If so, install
them. If you installed Ruby and the <span class="caps">KDE</span> libraries by hand, the header files are
already installed. The next part of the installation changes depending on the version
of <span class="caps">KDE</span> you&#8217;ve installed.</p>
<h5>For <span class="caps">KDE</span> up to 4.6.x</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Download the <code>kdebindings</code> tarball from the <a href="http://www.kde.org/download"><span class="caps">KDE</span> home page</a>.
  Choose the same version as your <span class="caps">KDE</span> libraries.</li>
	<li>Unpack the tarball.</li>
	<li><span class="shell">cd</span> in the directory created unpacking the tarball</li>
	<li>If you&#8217;re using ruby 1.9.2 and are installing a version of korundum lesser than
  4.5.3, run the following two commands:
  <pre class="shell"><code>
    sed -i -e 's#STR2CSTR(rb_obj_as_string#RSTRING_PTR(rb_obj_as_string#'\
      ruby/korundum/src/krubypluginfactory.cpp@
    sed -i -e "s#STR2CSTR#StringValueCStr#"\
      ruby/korundum/src/krubypluginfactory.cpp@
  </code></pre></li>
	<li>Create a build directory: <code>mkdir build</code></li>
	<li><span class="shell">cd build</span></li>
	<li><span class="shell">cmake ..</span></li>
	<li>If you had a <span class="caps">KDE</span> environment installed before deciding to install Ruber, check,
  using your package manager, whether you also have a package called <code>smoke</code> installed</li>
	<li>run <span class="shell">ccmake .</span> This will give you a pseudo-graphical interface where to set
  some options. In particular, you may want to change the installation directory
  by setting the <code>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</code> option. Most likely, you&#8217;ll also want to
  avoid building the bindings for languages other than Ruby, so set the corresponding <code>BUILD_*</code>
  options (for example, <code>BUILD_perl</code>) to <code>OFF</code>. If you already have <code>smoke</code> installed,
  also set <code>BUILD_smoke</code> to <code>OFF</code>. After changing
  the options you need, press <code>c</code> to configure and <code>g</code> to generate. Then <code>e</code> to
  exit</li>
	<li><span class="shell">make</span></li>
	<li><span class="shell">make install</span>. Unless you changed the installation directory to a directory
  you have write access to, this command must be run as superuser.</li>
</ul>
<h5>For <span class="caps">KDE</span> from 4.7.0</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Download the <code>smokegen</code>, <code>smokeqt</code>, <code>smokekde</code>, <code>qtruby</code> and <code>korundum</code> tarballs
  from the <a href="http://www.kde.org/download"><span class="caps">KDE</span> website</a>.</li>
	<li>If you installed <span class="caps">KDE</span> using your package manager, you may use it to also install
  the <code>smokeqt</code> and <code>smokekde</code> packages. If so, you can ignore both them and <code>smokegen</code>
  in the previous list.</li>
	<li>For each of the downloaded tarballs (in the order given above), do the following:</li>
	<li>unpack the tarball and <span class="shell">cd</span> in the directory containing the code</li>
	<li>create a build directory: <span class="shell">mkdir build</span></li>
	<li>run <span class="shell">cmake ..</span></li>
	<li>run <span class="shell">cmake .</span>. This will give you a pseudo-graphical interface where to set
  some options. In particular, you may want to change the installation directory
  by setting the <code>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</code> option. When you&#8217;re finished with the options,
  press <code>c</code> to configure and <code>g</code> to generate. Then <code>e</code> to exit.</li>
	<li>run <span class="shell">make</span></li>
	<li>run <span class="shell">make install</span>. Unless you changed the installation directory to a directory
  you have write access to, this command must be run as superuser.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installing plugin dependencies</h2>
<ul>
	<li><code>rake</code>: <span class="shell">gem install rake</span> (you don&#8217;t need this if using ruby 1.9, unless you want
  to install a newer version of rake)</li>
	<li><code>rspec</code>: <span class="shell">gem install rspec</span></li>
	<li><code>rak</code>: <span class="shell">gem install rak</span>. If you&#8217;re using ruby 1.9, you may want to edit
    the source code of rak to avoid encoding issues. To do so, you&#8217;ll have to find
    out where rubygems installed it. It&#8217;ll be in the <code>gems/rak-x.y.z</code> subdirectory
    of one of the directories listed by <span class="shell">gem env</span> command under the <code>GEM PATHS</code>
    heading. Once located the directory where rak is installed, make the following
    changes to the <code>bin/rak</code> file (thanks to FooBarWidget who made a pull request
    with this fix on the rak github page):
	<ul>
		<li>after the first line of the file, add the code <code># encoding: binary</code></li>
		<li>on line 486, replace <code>f = File.open(fn, "r")</code> with <code>f = File.open(fn, "rb")</code></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><code>rdoc</code>: <span>(shell) gem install rdoc</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Building the <span class="caps">API</span> documentation</h2>
<p>Ruber&#8217;s documentation is written in <span class="caps">YARD</span> format, using Textile as markup format.
If you truly want, you can use RDoc to generate the documentation, but you&#8217;ll miss
some information (in particular regarding signals and slots) and the formatting 
will be missing or wrong.</p>
<h3>Building the documentation using <span class="caps">YARD</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Install Ruber</li>
	<li>Install <span class="caps">YARD</span> e RedCloth: <span class="shell">gem install yard rdoc</span> (or use your package manager
  to install them)</li>
	<li><span class="shell">cd</span> to the directory you installed Ruber into (to find out where this is, look
  at the output <code>gem environment</code>, in particular at the <code>GEM_PATHS</code> entry. Ruber
  will be installed under the <code>gems/ruber-x.y.z</code> subdirectory of one of the
  directories listed there)</li>
	<li>Issue the command <span class="shell">rake doc OUTPUT_DIR=/path/to/output/dir</span> command. <code>OUTPUT_DIR</code>
  is the directory where you want to install the documentation. If you don&#8217;t specify
  it, it&#8217;ll be installed under the <code>doc</code> directory in the Ruber installation directory.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Building the documentation using rdoc</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Install Ruber</li>
	<li><span class="shell">cd</span> to the directory you installed Ruber into (see above how to find it)</li>
	<li>Issue the command <span class="shell">rake rdoc OUTPUT_DIR=/path/to/output/dir</span> command. <code>OUTPUT_DIR</code>
  is the directory where you want to install the documentation. If you don&#8217;t specify
  it, it&#8217;ll be installed under the <code>rdoc</code> directory in the Ruber installation directory.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Installing other plugins</h3>
<p>Currently, the only way to install a plugin is to download the tarball and extract
it in one of the directories where Ruber looks for plugins( by default, they are
the <code>plugins</code> subdirectory of the Ruber installation directory and
<code>$KDEHOME/share/apps/ruber/plugins</code>). This should create a subdirectory named as
the plugin in that directory.</p>
<h2>Using the development version of Ruber</h2>
<p>If you want to use a version of Ruber which hasn&#8217;t as yet been released, you can
download the source code from the git repository and install it by hand. To do so,
make sure you have all the prerequisites installed, then download the source code
doing one of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>clone Ruber&#8217;s git repository: <span class="shell">git clone git://github.com/stcrocco/ruber.git</span>.
  You need to have <a href="http://www.git-scm.com/">git</a> installed to do this.</li>
	<li>go to the <a href="github.com/stcrocco/ruber">Ruber project page</a>, then press the download
  button and choose either the <code>Download .tar.gz</code> or the <code>Download .zip</code> entry. 
  This will download a compressed file with the appropriate extension on your computer.
  Extract this file with the appropriate method.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, enter the directory where you&#8217;ve downloaded the source code and issue <span class="shell">rake
ruber</span>. This is needed to generate files describing the user interface (mainly
dialogs) from files produced by the <code>Qt Designer</code> program. Once this is done,
you can run Ruber from this directory with the following command: <span class="shell">ruby -Ilib bin/ruber</span>.
If you only want to try the development version once or twice, or if you want to
help developing Ruber, that&#8217;s all you need to do. If you want to go on using it,
and want to run it with a simple <code>ruber</code>, you&#8217;ll have to build a gem with <span class="shell">gem build
ruber.gemspec</span> followed by <span class="shell">gem install ruber-x.y.z.gem</span>, where <code>ruber-x.y.z</code> is
the file generated by the previous command.</p>
