=begin rdoc
Executes the action with a given name, if it belongs to the plugin's action collection

To execute the action, this method first checks whether it is included in the @actions@
entry of the PSF. If so, then the associated slot is directly called, passing 
_<notextile>*</notextile>args_ as argument. If the action is not included in that entry, then
the action object is forced to emit a signal according to its class: @toggled(bool)@
for a @KDE::ToggleAction@, @triggered()@ for a @KDE::Action, and
@triggered(*args)@ for all other actions.

If a plugin needs a different behaviour, for example because the slot connected to
the action uses @Qt::Object.sender@, and thus can only be called from a
signal, you'll need to override this method and have the action emit the signal.
To do so, you can use the following code:

bc.

a = action_collection.action(name)
a.instance_eval{emit signal_name(arg)}
 
where @name@ is the name of the action, @signal_name@ is the name of the
signal to emit and @arg@ is the argument of the signal (you can pass more
than one argument, if needed).

If the slot is called directly, _args_ are the arguments to be passed to the slot.
If the signal is emitted, _args_ are the arguments passed to the signal.

*Note:* emitting the signal can (in rare cases) have unwanted results. This
can happen if there are more than one slot connected to the signal, in which case
all of them will be called. Usually, this shouldn't be an issue since it's common
to connect only one signal to each action, but it can happen. This is why this
method prefers to call the slot directly, whenever possible.

@param [String,Symbol] name the name of the action to execute
@param [<Object>] args the arguments to pass to the slot or the signal
@return [Boolean] *true* if an action called _name_ was found and *false* otherwise

      data = plugin_description.actions[name.to_s]

entry of the PSF entry corresponding to the action

@states@ entry (the @state@ entry isn't used).

@param [String] name the name of the action for which the action handler is registered

when the action handler is registered
