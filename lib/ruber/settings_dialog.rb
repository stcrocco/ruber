require 'ruber/settings_dialog_manager'

module Ruber

=begin rdoc
Dialog used to change the options contained in an SettingsContainer. It is a specialized
@KDE::PageDialog@.

The widgets added to the option container are displayed in pages corresponding to
the captions included in the widgets' description. If more than one widget has
the same caption, they're displayed in the same page, one below the other (using
a @Qt::VBoxLayout@). The icon used for each page is the first one found among the
widgets in that page.

The process of keeping the options in sync between the widgets and the option container
can be automatized using the functionality provided by the internal SettingsDialogManager.
If this automatic management can't be achieved for a particular option (for example,
because the value should be obtained combining the data of more than one widget),
you can still automatically manage the other widgets and integrate the manual
management of the widgets which need it with the automatic management. To do so,
you need to define three methods in your widget: @read_settings@, @store_settings@ and @read_default_settings@. They can all take no arguments or take the container as only argument.

h3. Manual option management example

Suppose you have an option called @default_path@ in the @general@ group which stores a path. In
your widget, however, the path is split in two parts: the directory and the filename,
which are shown in two line edit widgets, called respectively @default_dir_widget@
and @default_file_widget@. Since the automatic option management system assumes
that each option corresponds to a single widget, you can't use it. So, you define
a @read_settings@, a @store_settings@ and a @read_default_settings@
method in your widget class like this:

<pre>class MyWidget < Qt::Widget

  def initialize parent = nil
    super
    @default_dir_widget = KDE::LineEdit.new self
    @default_file_widget = KDE::LineEdit.new self
  end

  def read_settings dialog
    path = dialog.settings_container[:general, :default_path]
    @default_dir_widget.text = File.dirname(path)
    @default_file_widget.text = File.basename(path)
  end
  
  def store_settings dialog
    path = File.join @default_dir_widget.text, @default_file_widget.text
    dialog.settings_container[:general, :default_path] = path
  end
  
  def read_default_settings dialog
    path = dialog.settings_container.default(:general, :default_path)
    @default_dir_widget.text = File.dirname(path)
    @default_file_widget.text = File.basename(path)
  end

end
</pre>

=begin rdoc
Creates a new SettingsDialog. The dialog will store settings in the SettingsContainer
_container_, manage the options _options_ and display the widgets _widgets_.
_options_ is an array of option objects (see SettingsContainer#add_option).
_widgets_ is an array containing
the description of the widgets to be displayed in the dialog (see SettingsContainer#add_widget).

This method defines a new instance variable for each widget it creates. The variable
is called @settings_dialog and contains a reference to the dialog itself. It can be
used from custom widgets' implementation of read_settings, store_settings and
read_default_settings methods to access the option container corresponding to
the dialog.

This method takes the values from the dialog widgets and stores them in to option container.
It calls the store_settings method of the option dialog manager and the store_settings
method of each widgets which provide it, then calls the write method of the container
so that the options are written to file.

Method called to create a widget which is specified using a <tt>code</tt> entry
in the third argument to initialize. _code_ is the string containing the code.

It evaluates _code_ in the toplevel binding and returns the resulting object. Derived
classes may override it to change this behaviour (for example, they may want to
evaluate the code in another binding).

Method called to create a widget which is specified using the <tt>class_obj</tt> entry
in the third argument to initialize. _cls_ is the widget's class.

The widget is created simply calling new on _cls_ (no arguments are passed to it).
Derived classes may want to override it to change this behaviour (for example,
they may want to pass some argument to +new+).
