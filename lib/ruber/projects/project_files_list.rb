=begin rdoc
Project extension to access the name of the files belonging to the project.

The file belonging to the projects are determined using the contents of the @general/project_files@
project option. This option is a hash which contains rules (in the form of hashes)
telling which files are part of the project and which aren't.

Files are kept up to date, both regarding the contents of the filesystem (using a
KDE::DirWatch) and the rules specified in the project.

To avoid needlessly freezing the application in case projects with a large number of files,
this class only scans the project directory when a list of project files is actually
requested, that is when one of the methods {#each}, {#abs}, {#rel} and {#project_files}
is called. Even in that case, the project directory is only scanned if a file has
been added or removed since the last scan, or if the rules have changed since then.
A scan can be forced by using the {#update} method, but you usually don't need this.

h3. Rules

The @general/project_files@ setting is a hash containing the rules to use to decide
whether a given file belongs to the project or not. There are two groups of rules:
inclusive rules and exclusive rules. Inclusive rules specify files which belong
to the project, while exclusive rules specify files which do not belong to the 
project. Exclusive rules have precedence on inclusive rules, meaning that if a
file matches both an inclusive and an exclusive rule, it's excluded from the project.

There are three kinds of rules:


Project extension which scans the project directory and finds out which files belong
to the project and which don't (according to rules specified by the user in the
project options), returning an array of the former.

It also watches the project directory to update the list of project files when a
file in the project directory is added or removed.

This class provides an {#each} method, which yields all the project files to the
block or, if called without a block, returns an <tt>Enumerable::Enumerator</tt>
which does the same.

<b>Note:</b> the list of project files is created lazily, only when a method
explicitly needs it and a file or directory (or the rules) have changed since
the last time it was generated. A <tt>KDE::DirWatch</tt> object is used to find
out when a file or directory changes. Also, after a file has changed, the watcher
is stopped until the list is updated again (a single change is enough to rebuild
the whole list, so there's no point in keeping watching).

The methods which can cause the list to be rebuild are: +each+, +abs+, +rel+ and 
<tt>project_files</tt>.

===Rules
To decide whether a file belongs to the project or not, ProjectFilesList uses
the general/project_files project option. It is a hash made of three keys, each
specifying a rule telling whether a file is part of the project or not. In application
order, they are
<tt>extensions</tt>::
  an array of shell globs. Any file matching one of them (according to <tt>File.fnmatch</tt>)
  will be considered a project file, unless another rule says otherwise
<tt>include</tt>::
  an array of strings and/or regexps corresponding to files which belong to the
  project. Each string entry is the name (relative to the project directory) of
  a file which belongs to the project. Each regexp is a pattern which should be
  tested against all the names (still relative to the project directory) of the
  files in the project directory (and its subdirectories). Each matching file will
  be a project file (unless another rule says otherwise).
<tt>exclude</tt>::
  as the <tt>include</tt> entry, but the matching files will *not* be project
  files. This entry has the precedence with respect to the other two. This means
  that if a file is a project file according to one of them but also matches a
  rule here, it <i>won't</i> be considered a project file.

Creates a new ProjectFilesList for the Project _prj_.

The new object will read the <tt>general/project_files</tt> option from the project

Besides, it will start monitoring the directory for changes, so as to be
able to update the list of project files when a new file is created or a file
is deleted.

Returns an array with the name of the files in the project (in arbitrary order).
If _abs_ is *false*, the file names will be relative to the project directory;
if it is *true* they'll be absolute. It is the same as calling <tt>list.abs.to_a</tt>

If called with a block, calls the block yielding the names of the files in the

Tells whether the given file belongs to the project or not. If _file_ is a relative
path, it is considered relative to the project directory.

Returns *true* if _file_ belongs to the project and *false* otherwise. As this method
doesn't access the filesystem, the behaviour in the case _file_ is a directory will
be undefined. If _file_ ends with a slash (which makes it clear it represents a
directory) then *nil* will be returned
<b>Note:</b> this method doesn't use the file list to tell whether the file is in
the project. Rather, it compares the file name with the include and exclude rules
and the extensions.

two threads calling this method together, since Dir.chdir doesn't nest inside
