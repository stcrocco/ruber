It is a wrapper around ComponentManager#load_plugins which allows an easier handling
of exceptions raised by the loaded plugins.

If a block is given, it is passed to ComponentManager#load_plugins, to determine
what to do if an exception is raised while loading a plugin. If no block is given
and _silent_ is *false*, then a dialog displaying the error message is shown to
the user, who has the following options: ignore the plugin which gave the error,
skip all the remaining plugins, go on ignoring other errors or aborting. If no
block is given and _silent_ is a true value, then all errors will be ignored.

_plugins_ should be an array containing the names of the plugins to load
(dependencies) will be computed automatically. _dirs_ is an array containing the
directories where to look for plugins. If *nil*, the values stored in the
"Plugin directories" entry in the configuration file will be used.

<b>Note:</b> this method doesn't attempt to handle exceptions raised while computing
or sorting dependencies.
