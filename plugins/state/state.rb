module Ruber

=begin rdoc
Plugin which allows Ruber to store and restore back its state.

In this context, the term _state_ means the open project and documents, the position
of the cursor in each document and the active document. All this data is stored
in the configuration file and in the project or document project files. Using
the API provided by this plugin, it is possible to restore a single document,
project or the whole application to the state it was when it was last closed.

In addition to providing an API for saving and restoring state, this plugin also
restores the full Ruber state when restoring a session and (according to the
user preferences) when the application starts up.

Executes a block temporarily overriding the user's settings about what should be
restored and what shouldn't.

Nested calls to this method are allowed. By default, the outer call wins over the
inner, meaning that a value set by the inner call are only used if the outer
call didn't set that value. You can change this behaviour by passing the @:force@
option.

remain as chosen by the user

method, the values specified by the inner call will override values set by the
outer call.

in documents should be restored, regardless of what the user chose
