module Ruber

=begin rdoc
Plugin which allows to evaluate some ruby code from within the Ruber environment,
thus effectively giving Ruber commands (this is different from the Ruby Runner
plugin, which simply starts a new ruby interpreter and runs a script in it).

This plugin doesn't provide a plugin class but just a tool widget where the user
can enter the code and a button to execute it. It also doesn't provide any
API for the feature.

*Note:* the ruby code is executed in the top level context. Any exception
raised by the code won't cause Ruber to crash, but will be displayed in a dialog.

Executes the text in the tool widget in the ruby interpreter where Ruber is running
in. If an exception is raised by the code, it won't be propagated to Ruber. Instead,
it will be displayed on standard error and in a message box.
      
@return [Boolean] *true* if the code was executed successfully and *false* if an exception
was raised.
