h1. The Plugin Specification File

The Plugin Specification File (PSF) is a file which describes the contents and the
characteristics of a plugin. It's written in YAML format, must be called @plugin.yaml@
and be placed inside the plugin's directory.

The PSF contains a single hash, whose entries can be divided in two logical sections:
an introduction which only contains generic information, such as the plugin name,
its description, which plugins it depends on and so on, and a detailed description
containing, for example, the files to require before loading the plugin, the options
provided by the plugin and so on.

Here's a complete list of the PSF entries. Keys can be either symbols or strings,
and will be converted to strings upon reading (the same is true wherever the following
description says that something can be either a string or symbol)[1]. All entries,
except those explicitly marked as mandatory, are optional. The default values are
given in the description of each entry.

h2. PSF Introduction

h4. @type@ [Mandatory]

The type of plugin the PSF describes. It must be one of the following (either
a string or a symbol can be used):

- core := a core component of Ruber. This should only be used in the PSFs that
  describe ruber core components and can't be used by plugins written by the
  user.

- library := the PSF describes a library plugin. A library plugin can't be unloaded
  after it's been loaded and can't provide any extra feature. They should be
  used for plugins other plugins will depend on in non-standard ways (for example
  plugins providing classes other plugins will derive from). A library plugin
  may only depend on other library plugins

- global := the PSF describes a plugin which is loaded globally and affects Ruber
  as a whole. These are the plugins  which can be chosen from the Choose Plugins
  dialog in the Settings menu. A gobal plugin may depend on both global and
  library plugins.

- project := the PSF describes a plugin which should affect a single project
  and can be loaded multiple times, each time for a different project. A project
  plugin may depend only on project and library plugins.

h4. @name@ [Mandatory]

The name of the plugin. It can be either a string or symbol
and is the name Ruber uses to make the plugin availlable to other components. It's
mostly invisible to users. In theory, it can contain any character, but in practice
it's better to use a symbol which can be entered using the ruby symbol literal
syntax (@:something@). This means it should abide the same restrictions as a method
name. The plugin name **must** be unique.

h4. @version@ [Mandatory]

The plugin version. It's a string and can have any format, but the @x.y.z@ format
is recomanded.

h4. @about@

A hash with some information about the plugin which can be useful to the user. If
missing, an empty hash is used. The following keys are recognized:

* *human_name*: a string or symbol with a human friendly name for the plugin. Unlike
the @name@ entry, this has no meaning for Ruber itself (in particular, there's
no need for uniqueness, even if it's still suggested) and so it can be anything the
plugin author likes. If missing, the human name is derived from the @name@ entry
by replacing all underscores with spaces and making the first character upcase.

* *authors*: an array of pairs. Each pair corresponds to one of the
plugin's authors. The first element of the pair is the author's name, while the
second is his e-mail address. The second entry of a pair may also be omitted, in
which case an empty string is used. If the plugin has only one author, then the
external array may be omitted. If this entry is missing, an empty array will be
used.

* *license*: a symbol or string specifying the license under which the plugin is
released. The following values are recognized: @unknown@, @gpl@, @gpl2@, @lgpl@,
@lgpl2@, @bsd@, @artistic@, @qpl@, @qpl1@, @gpl3@, @lgpl3@. The licenses ending
with a number mean that the plugin is released under that exact version of the
license, while if the number is missing it means any version of the license. If
the value is a string different from the values just listed, Ruber assumes the
string contains the text of a custom license. A symbol different from those values,
instead, produces an invalid PSF. If omitted, @unknown@ is used.

* *description*: a string with a short description of what the plugin does. If
omitted, an empty string is used.

* *bug_address*: a string containing the e-mail address to report bugs for the
plugin. If missing, an empty string is used.

* *icon*: a string containing the path of the file with the icon associated with
the plugin, relative to the plugin directory. If the file can't be found there,
an attempt is made to find it using @KDE::IconLoader@.

h4. @deps@

An array of strings or symbols with the names of other plugins this one depends
from. If the plugin depends only one other plugin, the array can be omitted and
this entry can directly contain the name of the dependency. If omitted, Ruber
assumes the plugin doesn't depend on other plugins.

Note that only direct dependencies need to be listed here. If the plugin depends
on another plugin _A_, which in turn depends on the plugin _B_, you only need to
list _A_ here.

h2. PSF Details

h4. @require@ [Mandatory]

An array of strings containing the names of the files to be required before loading
the plugin, relative to the plugin directory. In particular, these files must
contain all the classes mentioned in other sections of the PSF.

If only one file needs to be required, it doesn't need to be enclosed in the array.

h4. @class@

The full name of the class of the plugin object. It must be a class which is 
availlable after having required all files listed in the _require_ section.

If omitted, it defaults to {Ruber::Plugin}. This usually only happens if the
plugin only needs to add extensions to documents and projects.

h4. @ui_file@

The path (relative to the plugin directory) of the XML file to be used with
@KDE::XMLGuiClient@ to describe the ui of the plugin (in particular, menu entries
and toolbars). If the plugin class derives (maybe indirectly) from {Ruber::GuiPlugin},
this entry is *mandatory*, otherwise it *must* not be given.

h4. @actions@

A hash containing data describing the actions associated with the plugin. It is
ignored if the <i>ui_file</i> is missing (that is, for plugins which do not derive
from {Ruber::GuiPlugin}).

The keys of the hash are the names of the actions as they appear in the UI file,
while the values are hashes which can have the following entries:
* @text@: a string with the text to display in the menu
* @shortcut@: a string with the default shortcut to associate with the action. If
missing, the action will have no default shortcut
* @icon@: the icon to associate with the action. It can be either a filename relative
to the plugin directory or an icon which can be loaded using @KDE::IconLoader@.
If omitted, no icon will be associated with the action. It's best to specify it
if the action should be inserted in a toolbar
* @standard_action@: a string with the name of the method in @KDE::StandardActions@
to call to create the action. This entry should only be present if the action
should actually be a standard action.
* @class@: a string with the full name of the class of the action. If missing,
the action will be a @KDE::Action@. This entry is only needed to create actions
of a special class (for example, toggle actions or recent files actions). This
entry is also not needed for standard action.
* @receiver@: a string which, after having been evaluated in the context of the
plugin object will return the object to connect the action's signal to. If missing,
it defaults to *self*, that is the plugin object
* @signal@: a string with the signal of the actions to connect with the receiver
(including the signal signature).
If missing, it defaults to @triggered()@
* @slot@: the slot of the receiver to connect with the signal of the action, as
specified in the _receiver_ and _signal_ entries (including the signal signature).
If missing, the action's signal won't be connected with anything (in this case,
of course, the _receiver_ and _signal_ entries are ignored).
* @state@: a string with a single state the action depends on (see {Ruber::GuiStatesHandler}).
If given, then a handler for that action will be created
* @states@: an array of string representing the states the action depends upon.
Unlike for the _state_ entry, no action handler is created for these states. This
entry is used by the {Ruber::GuiPlugin#register_action_handler} convenience method.

h4. @config_options@

This entry contains the settings that the plugin adds to the configuration manager
and which will be shown in the _Configure Ruber_ dialog.

See "Option entries":#common_options_entries below for a description of the entry.

If this entry is missing, then the plugin will add no global option.

h4. @config_widgets@

An array of hashes, where each hash describes a widget which should be put in the
_Configure Ruber_ dialog. See "below":#common_widget_entries
for a description of these hashes, keeping in mind that the _caption_ entry of
each hash is required. See also {Ruber::SettingsDialog} for more information.

If the plugin has only one configuration widget, the array can be omitted and this
entry may simply contain the hash describing the widget.

If this entry is omitted, the plugin will have no configuration widget.

h4. @project_options@

This entry contains the settings which the plugin adds to projects and documents.

See "Option entries":#common_options_entries below for a description of the entry,
keeping in mind that each inner hash can also have the entries described in the
"Rules entries section":#common_rules_entries.

If this entry is missing the plugin will add no option to projects and documents.

h4. @project_widgets@

An array of hashes, where each hash describes a widget which should be put in the
_Configure Project_ and/or _Configure Document_ dialogs. See "below":#common_widget_entries
for a description of these hashes, keeping in mind that the _caption_ entry of
each hash is required and that each hash can also contain the entries described in the
"Rules entries section":#common_rules_entries. See also {Ruber::SettingsDialog} for
more information.

h4. @tool_widgets@

An array of hashes, where each hash represents one of the tool widget provided
by the plugin. The hash as the format described in the "widget entries section":#common_widget_entries,
with both caption and icon mandatory. In addition, it can contain the following
entries:
* @side@: a string or symbol which can take the values @left@, @right@ or @bottom@.
It tells on which side of the editor the tool widget should be put. If it isn't
specified, it defaults to @bottom@.
* @name@: a string or symbol with an unique name which can be used to identify the
tool widget. If not given, the caption will be used
* @variable_name@: if given and not *nil*, after the tool widget has been created
it will be stored in an instance variable with this name inside the plugin object.
If this entry is missing, the instance variable will be @@widget@. If this entry
is explicitly set to *nil*, the tool widget won't be stored in an instance variable.
Note that the leading @@@ shouldn't be included in this entry.

If this entry is missing, the plugin will provide no tool widget.

h4. @extensions@

A hash describing the extensions provided by the plugin. The hash's keys are strings
or symbols representing the extensions names (which should be uinque), while the
values are hashes which describe the extension.

Each hash can have the entries described in the "Rules entries section":#common_rules_entries
and a mandatory @class@ entry, which is a string with the full name of the class
of the extension.

In some situations, it can be useful to use different classes for the same extension,
depending on which rule matches (for example, the extension for a document and that
for a project may provide the same API, but use different implementations, and thus
be of different classes). In this case, the value associated to the extension should
be an array containing the hashes for the different rules. For each document or
project, the first entry with a matching rule will be used.

If this entry is missing, the plugin will provide no extensions.

h2. Common entries

h4(#common_options_entries). Option entries

An options entry is a series of nested hashes. The outer one represents the groups
the options are divided into. It has the group names as keys and hashes as values.

Each hash in a group represents an option. It has the names of the options as keys
and hashes describing each option as values.

Each inner hash describes an option. The recognized entries are:
* @default@: it represents the value the option has if the configuration file
doesn't specify a value for it. This option can have any value (if the entry is
missing, the default value will be an empty string). For convenience,
if it is a string, it's treated in a special way:
** an attempt is made to evaluate the string in a context which depends on the
specific entry. If the attempt succeeds (that is, if @eval@ doesn't raise exceptions),
the value returned by @eval@ is used as default value
** if @eval@ raised an exception, the literal value of the string is used as default
value
** if the <i>eval_default</i> entry is *false*, the listeral value of the string
is always used and no attempt to evaluate it is made.
* @order@: the order in which options should be created. Usually, the order in which
options are created doesn't matter. However, there are situations when the default
value of an option depends on the value of another option. In this case, the _order_
parameter for the two options should be set to a number, with the option to be
created earlier having a lower number. Options for which this entry is missing are
created in an arbitrary order
* @eval_default@: whether or not to attempt to evaluate the content of the _default_
entry if it is a string. This should be set to false if the _default_ entry is a
string which can be successfully evaluated but needs to be treated as string instead
(for example, if the default value should be the string "Object", you need to set
this entry to *false*, otherwise you'd get the object @Object@ as default value).
If not given, this entry is *true*.

Besides the above ones, each inner hash can also contain other entries, depending
on the exact entry.

h4(#common_widget_entries). Widget entries

A widget entry is a hash which describes a widget. The following entries are recognized:
* @class@: a string with the full name of the widget's class
* @code@: a string which, when evaluated, returns the widget object
* @caption@: a text to display for the widget (depending on the use of the widget
entry, the exact way the caption is shown varies. For a tool widget, for example,
it is displayed near the icon when the tool widget is visible). If missing, it
defaults to an empty string
* @pixmap@: a string with the name of the file of a pixmap to display for the widget
(as for the _caption_, here also the exact way the pixmap is displayed may vary).
The icon may be either in the plugin's directory or be obtain using @KDE::IconLoader@.

The _caption_ and _pixmap_ entries may be or not mandatory depending on the exact
entry (for example, only the caption entry is mandatory for the <i>config_widgets</i>
entry, but are mandatory for the _tool_widgets_ entry).

One and *only* one of the _class_ and _code_ entries *must* be specified.

The _code_ entry is useful, for example, to avoid creating a class when the same
effect can be obtained with a line of two of code (for instance, if a configuration
widget is a single check box, you can set the _code_ entry to @Qt::CheckBox.new{|w| w.text = "Something"}@
instead of creating a new widget class just to set the text of the checkbox)

h4(#common_rules_entries). Rules entries

A rule is a series of properties which tells whether an extension, project option
or project widget (which here we'll call "objects") should be added to a project or
document or not (see {Ruber::AbstractProject#match_rule?} for more). As described
above, extensions, project options and project widgets are represented in the PSF
by hashes. A rule is made by several standard entries in those hashes. The entries
are:
* @scope@: tells whether the object should be added only to global projects,
only to documents or to both. It is an array containing strings or symbols, which
should match the scope of the global project or document project (see {Ruber::Project#scope}
and {Ruber::DocumentProject#scope}). For convenience, if the array contains a single
entry, it can be avoided. Also, this entry can be @all@, which matches all scopes.
If this entry is missing, it defaults to @project@
* @file_extension@: an array of strings, where each string is a shell glob. For
the object to be added to a document, its file name must match at least one of the
globs. A single string doesn't need to be put an array. If this entry is missing,
the name of the file associated with the document isn't taken into account when
deciding whether to add the object to the document or not. Note that if at least
a glob is specified, the object will never be added to documents not associated
with a file
* @mimetype@: an array of strings, each containing the name of a mimetype. The
object will be added to a document only if its mimetype matches at least one of
the ones given here (see {Ruber::Document#file_type_match?} for details). If
a single mimetype is specified, there's no need to include it in an array. If
this entry isn't given, the mimetype won't be taken into account.

fn1. This is one of many examples where the contents of the PSF differ from the
internal representation which Ruber uses for them. In the PSF, some entries can
be written in a concise way to make life easier for plugin writers, but they're
converted to another format when the {Ruber::PluginSpecification PluginSpecification}
object corresponding to the PSF is created. This also allows to have alternative
ways to specify an entry in the PSF while retaining a single internal representation.
See <a href="file.plugin_specification_object">the plugin specification object</a>
for details about such differences.
