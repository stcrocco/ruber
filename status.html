        <h2>Status</h2>
<p>Despite the fact I&#8217;ve been developing it for a couple of years, Ruber is still
currently in alpha state. This is mostly my fault, because I have sometimes spent
months working very little on it. However, I have been using it for its own development
for a long time and I think it works quite well.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a short list of shortcomings of the current version. A list of planned
changes to be made and features to be added is availlable <a href="apidoc/index.html">here</a></p>
<h3>Current issues</h3>
<h4>Random crashes on the C++ side</h4>
<p>Although the <span class="caps">KDE</span> ruby bindings are very well done and complete, they do have a
drawback: if your ruby code causes the C++ side to fail somehow, you get a long
backtrace containing only references to the internals of the bindings, which are
completely useless if you are not a korundum developer.</p>
<p>What this means is that these crashes are quite difficult to fix. I&#8217;m going to ask
help to the <span class="caps">KDE</span> bindings developer about this, but I&#8217;ve waited to have the source
online before doing that so that they can have a look at the program, in case they
need it.</p>
<p>Note that, at least with my workflow, these crashes never caused data loss. I only
had to start Ruber again.</p>
<h4>Random crashes on the Ruby side</h4>
<p>Every now and then, when starting Ruber, you can get an exception about a <code>to_sym</code>
called on <code>nil</code>. I haven&#8217;t as yet figured out what&#8217;s causing this, expecially since
starting Ruber again doesn&#8217;t cause the issue anymore. Since this is only an inconvenience,
I&#8217;ve postponed investigating to after I&#8217;ve released the first alpha version of Ruber.</p>
<h4>Unstable <span class="caps">API</span></h4>
<p>Currently, the Ruber <span class="caps">API</span> is not completely stable. In particular, there are two
issues on my <span class="caps">TODO</span> list which most likely will require incompatible <span class="caps">API</span> changes 
that may affect plugin developers.</p>
<ul>
	<li>having open documents without a view, which will break the assumption that each
  document has a view associated with it</li>
	<li>allowing more than one open project</li>
</ul>
<h4>Missing plugins</h4>
<p>At the moment, the only plugins included with Ruber are the ones I needed most
to develop it. This means, for example, that there isn&#8217;t a <code>Test::Unit</code> plugin,
because I use RSpec for testing. My <a href="features.html#todo"><span class="caps">TODO</span></a> list contains a large number of plugins,
but before starting working on them, I wanted to finish some core functionality.</p>
<p>This, of course, shouldn&#8217;t stop anyone needing the missing plugins to start developing
them. I only ask that anyone intentioned to write, and release to the public, 
a plugin which is already on the <span class="caps">TODO</span> list contact me before starting, so that
we can exchange ideas and maybe have the plugin included with future releases of
Ruber</p>
<h4>Lacking documentation</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, Ruber is not completly documented. Originally, I&#8217;d decided to write
all documentation before the first public release, but, seeing large amount of
time documentation was taking, I changed my mind.</p>
<p>At the moment, Ruber code may be divided in three categories according to the
documentation status:</p>
<ul>
	<li>well documented: documentation is complete, up-to-date and written in <span class="caps">YARD</span> format.
  This includes all the plugins and some core files</li>
	<li>old documentation: the documentation is there but may be outdated and it&#8217;s in
  RDoc format. In particular, any documentation about signals and slots will most
  likely be outdated. This categories includes most of the core files</li>
	<li>(almost) not documented: some random files</li>
</ul>
