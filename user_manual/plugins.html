<h3 id="autoend">Auto end</h3>
<p>The auto end plugin automatically inserts an <code>end</code> keyword when you type a newline
(pressing Enter) after a line which contains a keyword starting a construct which
requires a matching <code>end</code>. The recognized keywords are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>module</code></li>
	<li><code>class</code></li>
	<li><code>def</code></li>
	<li><code>if</code></li>
	<li><code>do</code></li>
	<li><code>begin</code></li>
	<li><code>case</code></li>
	<li><code>for</code></li>
</ul>
<p>It also adds an <code>=end</code> after a line starting a block comment (<code>=begin</code>).</p>
<p>Finding out whether an <code>end</code> keyword needs to be inserted after a given line is not
an easy task. This plugin approaches the problem in the following way:</p>
<ul>
	<li>check if the current line <em>could</em> require an <code>end</code> keyword. This is done by checking
  whether it contains any of the keywords listed above, using some simple regexps</li>
	<li>if the line matches one of the regexps mentioned above, perform a syntax check
  using the Syntax Checker plugin. If the check reports a missing <code>end</code> keyword
  error, then an <code>end</code> keyword is added. Unfortunately, ruby error messages aren&#8217;t
  too reliable, so sometimes a spurious <code>end</code> might be inserted.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="autosave">Autosave</h3>
<p>The autosave plugin is used by other plugins to automatically save some files
(which files depends on the plugin) before running certain actions, according to
the settings chosen by the user (for example, the Ruby development plugin saves
all project files before running the script associated with the project). As user,
you don&#8217;t interact with the plugin, except to choose how it should behave.</p>
<p>In the Genral page of the Ruber configuration dialog there&#8217;s a section for the
Autosave plugin. It contains a check box, which allows you to turn autosaving on
or off for all plugin, and a checkable list of plugins under the Exceptions label.
When autsaving is globally enabled, you can disable it for a plugin by unchecking
the corresponding item from the list. Note that, if autosave is disabled globally,
there&#8217;s no way to enable it only for some plugins. You need to enable it globally
and manually disable it for the plugins you don&#8217;t want.</p>
<h3 id="command">Command</h3>
<p>The Command plugin allows you to directly interact with Ruber internals. It provides
a tool widget containing a text editor and an Execute button. Any ruby code written
in the text editor is executed in the Ruber environment (in the context of the
toplevel object) by using <code>eval</code>. All exceptions produced by your code are caught
and displayed in a message box, so Ruber won&#8217;t crash even if your code here is
incorrect.</p>
<p>The tool widget also contains a Show Output button, which toggles the visibility
of another text widget (this one read-only). When you execute the code in the
text editor, all output to standard output and stadard error will be displayed
here instead.</p>
<h3 id="find-in-files">Find in files</h3>
<p>The Find in files plugin is a frontend for <a href="http://rak.rubyforge.org">rak</a>, which,
according to the author, is <i>a grep replacement in pure Ruby</i> which 
<i>accepts Ruby syntax regular expressions and automatically recurses directories</i>.</p>
<p>To use this plugin, choose the <code>Find and Replace in Files</code> entry from the Edit menu.
This displays a dialog similar to the one in the following picture.
<a href="../images/find_in_files_dialog.png">
  <img src="../images/find_in_files_dialog.png" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" alt="Find in files dialog"/>
</a></p>
<p>In the Find line edit, enter the text you want to find. It will be interpreted
as a regular expression or as plain text according to the value set in the Mode
combo box. If you want to replace the found occcurrences of the text with something
else, insert the replacement string in the Replace with line edit. You can use
back references here (<code>\1</code>, <code>\2</code> and so on).</p>
<p>Under the Options caption, you find widgets to control how the search is performed:
besides changing the mode as described above, you can decide whether the search
should be case sensitive and whether only whole words should match.</p>
<p>The entries under the Filter label can be used to restrict the files to search.
Checking the All Files radio button will cause the search to be carried out in
all files; checking the File type button, and then one or more of the entries in
the combo box next to it will cause the search to be performed only on files of the
selected kind. Finally, the Custom filter line edit can be used to enter a regexp
(not a shell glob) to add another filter in addition to the one provided by the
file type.</p>
<p>Under the Path entry there are the widgets to choose the set of files to search.
In the Search in combo box there are two or four entries (depending on whether or not
you have an open project):</p>
<dl>
	<dt>open files</dt>
	<dd>the search will be done among all files corresponding to documents
  opened in the editor (editor tabs with documents not corresponding to open files
  will be ignored)</dd>
	<dt>custom directory</dt>
	<dd>choosing this entry will enable the Directory <span class="caps">URL</span> widget next
  to the combo box: the search will be done in all the files in the directory chosen
  here</dd>
	<dt>project files</dt>
	<dd>the search will be performed on all files belonging to the current
  project</dd>
	<dt>project directory</dt>
	<dd>the search will be performed on all files in the current
  project&#8217;s directory</dd>
</dl>
<p>Obviously the last two entries will only be present if there&#8217;s an open project.</p>
<p>The list of files to search is restricted according to the filters defined in
the Filters section.</p>
<p>Once you filled the dialog according to your needs, press the Find or the Replace
button depending on what you want to do (note that the Replace button becomes the
default if the Replace with line edit contains some text).</p>
<h4>Finding text</h4>
<p>In response to the Find button, the dialog will be closed and the Find in Files
tool widget becomes visible. It contains a tree with the names of the file wehere
the text was found, having as children the list of matches. The numbers left to
the matches are the corresponding line numbers.</p>
<h4>Replacing text</h4>
<p>If you clicked the Replace button, instead, the Replace in Files tool widget will
be shown. It contains a tree somewhat similar to the one described above, with
some important differences. Each match has two columns, labelled
&#8220;Original text&#8221; and &#8220;Replacement text&#8221; as the names imply, the first contains the
text found in the file; the second shows the text as it would be modified. To the
left of each entry (both those with the file name and those with the match)
there&#8217;s a check box. Unchecking the box will exclude that entry from the replacement.
Note that unchecking a file entry will exclude all the matches in that file from
replacement.</p>
<p>After having inspected the results produced by the match and chosen which replacements
you actually want to carry out, you can press the Replace button in the tool widget
to perform the changes. Note that, if the contents of a file change between the
time it was searched and the time you click this button, the corresponding entries
in the tool widget will become disabled, and you won&#8217;t be able to do the replacements
in it.</p>
<p>If you decide that you don&#8217;t want to perform this replacement, you can use the
Clear button in the tool widget to empty it. This isn&#8217;t actually needed, but it
can avoid to press the Replace button by mistake.</p>
<p>If any files on which the replacement was carried is modified in the editor, the
plugin will attempt to save it (using the autosave plugin). If you chose not to
save them, they won&#8217;t be included in the replacement.</p>
<p>The plugin takes care of updating files open in the editor in which replacements
have been performed.</p>
<h3 id="irb"><span class="caps">IRB</span></h3>
<p>As the name says, this plugin allows the user to run an <span class="caps">IRB</span> session from within
a tool widget. Note that this is not a &#8220;Ruber console&#8221;, meaning it doesn&#8217;t allow
you to interact with Ruber internals (the <a href="#command">Command</a> plugin does something
like this): rather, it&#8217;s a separated process, just like the <span class="caps">IRB</span> you&#8217;d run in
a separate terminal.</p>
<p>The plugin provides a tool widget, where you can input your code and see the output
from <span class="caps">IRB</span>. The main part of the tool widget is taken by the area where the output
is displayed. At the bottom, there&#8217;s a line where you can enter the next line to
send to <span class="caps">IRB</span>. Pressing the <code>Return</code> or the <code>Enter</code> button will send the current text
to <span class="caps">IRB</span>. After that, the widget will become disabled until <span class="caps">IRB</span> has finished evaluating
the code.</p>
<p>At the right of the line widget, there are two buttons:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Restart <span class="caps">IRB</span>, which will stop the current <span class="caps">IRB</span> process and start a new one</li>
	<li>Interrupt Evaluation, which does the same as pressing <code>CTRL+C</code> does in a normal
  <span class="caps">IRB</span> session. You usually use this button to interrupt something which is requiring
  too much time. Due to the way this plugin works, some time may pass from the time
  you press the button to the time the evaluation is actually interrupted.</li>
</ul>
<p>The plugin also provides a page in the configuration dialog. There you can choose:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the path of the <span class="caps">IRB</span> program (which defaults to the path returned by <span class="shell">which irb</span>)</li>
	<li>the various prompts <span class="caps">IRB</span> should use. Configuring them is the same as configuring
  the entries in the <code>IRB.conf[:PROMPTS]</code> hash (for more on this, see the section
  &#8220;Configuring the prompt&#8221; of <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/irb.html">the chapter dedicated to <span class="caps">IRB</span></a>
  of Programming Ruby. The only difference is that you don&#8217;t have to add the ending
  <code>%s\n</code> to the <code>:RETURN</code> prompt: they&#8217;re automatically added by Ruber. The default
  prompts are those used by the <code>:DEFAULT</code> <span class="caps">IRB</span> prompt mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <span class="caps">IRB</span> plugin uses the colors chosen in the color page of the configuration dialog
to display input and output text. In particular, the input (the code <em>you</em> enter)
is displayed using the <em>message</em> color, while the output <span class="caps">IRB</span> sends is displayed
using the <em>output</em> color.</p>
<p>There are some differences between using <span class="caps">IRB</span> with this plugin and running <span class="caps">IRB</span> in
a terminal. The most important are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>you <strong>must not</strong> directly use IRB&#8217;s methods to change the prompt (that is, you
  must not change <code>IRB.conf[:PROMPTS]</code> or call <code>IRB::Context#prompt_mode=</code>). Use
  the Ruber configuration dialog as described above to change the prompt.</li>
	<li>to avoid freezing Ruber in case <span class="caps">IRB</span> keeps sending output at a very high speed
  (for example, when in an endless loop which prints some output), output sent by
  <span class="caps">IRB</span> is only processed once every 0.1 second. This means that in certain situations,
  output can come slower (possibly much slower) than it would running <span class="caps">IRB</span> in a
  terminal. In most situation, this shouldn&#8217;t be noticeable.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="project-browser">Project browser</h3>
<p>This plugin provides a tool widget which lists the files in the project directory
in a tree. You can choose whether to display only the files belonging to the project
or all the files in the directory by right-clicking in the tool widget and checking
or unchecking the Show Only Project Files entry.</p>
<p>Left-clicking on a file will close the tool widget and display the file in the
editor; doing so while pressing the Meta key will live the tool widget open.</p>
<p>If no project is open, will disable the tree view.</p>
<h3 id="rake">Rake</h3>
<p>This plugin allows to run rake tasks for the current project from within Ruber.
it requires that rake is installed to work (rake is included in the standard library
in ruby 1.9).</p>
<p>The plugin provides the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Run rake task for the current project from a dialog or menu</li>
	<li>Associate shortcuts to rake task for current project</li>
	<li>Associate shortcuts to rake task globally (quick tasks)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Rake page in the Ruber configuration dialog, you can choose the rake
program to use and whether standard output from rake should be synchronized or
not (this is implemented passing <code>-E '$stdout.sync=true'</code> to rake). You can also
setup quick tasks there (see <a href="#rake-quick-tasks">below</a>).</p>
<p>In the Rake page in the project configuration dialog, you can set several options
related to rake for the project itself:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the options to give to ruby when running rake</li>
	<li>the rake program to use (override the option set globally)</li>
	<li>the rakefile to use for the project. If left empty, rake will be left free to
  find out the rakefile by itself (from the project directory)</li>
	<li>the environment variables to pass to rake. It must be a list of strings of the
  form <code>VAR1=value1 VAR2=value2 VAR3="value 3" VAR4='value 4'</code>. If you need space
  in values, you need to quote the value. Note that the parsing of such strings
  may fail in unusual cases</li>
	<li>the maximum time allowed to rake to retrieve the list of tasks from a rakefile.
  In several circumstances, this plugin needs to find out from rake which tasks
  are defined in the rakefile. If the rakefile is improperly written this can freeze
  Ruber (for example, in case of an endless loop). To avoid this, the Rake plugin
  gives rake a maximum time to obtain the list of tasks. If you know that the
  rakefile for a given project needs more time than the default allowed to generate
  the list of tasks, you can increase the time</li>
	<li>whether standard output from rake should be synchronized or not. This overrides
  the global setting</li>
	<li>configure the tasks for the project (see <a href="#rake-project-tasks">below</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rake-tasks-for-current-project">Run rake tasks for current project</h4>
<p>To run tasks for the current project, you can use either the <code>Ruby/Rake/Run Rake Task</code>
or the <code>Ruby/Rake/Project Tasks</code> menu entries. The former will display a dialog
with a list of tasks defined in the rakefile associated with the project; the
second displays a submenu with the same tasks.</p>
<p>Since retrieving tasks from rake takes some time, this list is not update every
time the menu or the dialog are displayed (in particular, the first time you display
the dialog or the menu, the list may be empty). To update the list, you need to press
the Refresh Tasks button in the dialog or choose the Refresh Tasks entry from the
submenu.</p>
<p>To run a task from the dialog, select it from the list, then click the Ok button.
You can use the line edit above the list to search for a task in the list.</p>
<p>To run a task from the submenu, simply choose the correspoding entry.</p>
<p>Note that you can&#8217;t run the default task from either the menu or the dialog. To
do so, use the <code>Ruby/Rake/Run Default Task</code> menu entry.</p>
<h4 id="rake-project-tasks">Associate shortcuts to tasks for project</h4>
<p>You can associate a keyboard shortcut to tasks in the current project. To do so,
open the project configuration dialog and go to the Rake page. Under the Tasks
caption, you&#8217;ll find a list of tasks defined in the rakefile. As described
<a href="#rake-tasks-for-current-project">above</a>, the list of tasks may not be up-to-date.
Use the Refresh task button below to update it. Double-clicking on the Shortcut
column of the list will bring up a shortcut editor, where you can choose the shortcut
for the corresponding task. You can also add or remove tasks manually by using the
Add Tasks and Remove Tasks button.</p>
<h4 id="rake-quick-tasks">Quick tasks</h4>
<p>Quick tasks are task which you configure globally and are availlable for all projects.
They&#8217;re meant to be used for tasks you have in each project, so that you don&#8217;t have
to configure them each time (for example, almost of my projects have a <code>doc</code> task.
Defining a quick task with that name and assigning a shortcut to it, I can execute
the task with a single key press for any project).</p>
<p>You can execute quick tasks either by using the associated keyboard shortcut or
using the <code>Ruby/Rake/Quick Tasks</code> submenu.</p>
<p>You manage quick tasks from the Rake page of the Ruber configuration dialog. You
can add tasks using the Add Task dialog and remove them using the Remove Task dialog.
Double clicking on the task name or shortcut, you can edit them.</p>
<h3 id="ri">RI</h3>
<p>The RI plugin provides a tool widget to search the RI documentation.</p>
<p>The tool widget contains a line edit where you can enter the string to look
for and a text area where the results are shown. To start searching, press the
<code>Search</code> button or simply press <code>Return</code> ro <code>Enter</code> in the line edit.</p>
<p>The plugin can search for a class or method name or for a method name in a specific
class (as usual, use <code>Cls.method_name</code> for a class method and <code>Cls#method_name</code>
for an instance method). If more than a possible entry is found (for example, 
because a method is defined in different classes or provided by different libraries),
a list of all the results will be shown. Clicking on a link will display the
documentation in simple <span class="caps">HTML</span> format (the format is similar to the <span class="caps">HTML</span> produced
by RDoc, but without hyperlinks).</p>
<p>The RI library used by the plugin is the one associated with the current interpreter,
as explained in the description of the <a href="#ruby-development">Ruby development</a> plugin.</p>
<h3 id="rspec">RSpec</h3>
<p>The RSpec plugin allows to run rspec examples from within Ruber, displaying the
results in a tool widget. It will only work from within a project.</p>
<p>This plugin should work with both RSpec 1 and RSpec 2. It will use RSpec 2 if
<code>`which rspec`</code> returns finds something and RSpec 1 otherwise.</p>
<p>There are several options you should set from the RSpec page of the project
configuration dialog before you can use this plugin. That page contains several
settings:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Ruby options</dt>
	<dd>the options to pass ruby when running RSpec. Depending on your
  ruby and RSpec version, you may want to add <code>-I .</code> there, to make sure the current
  directory is included in the load path.</dd>
	<dt>RSpec</dt>
	<dd>here you can choose the path to the <code>rspec</code> or <code>spec</code> program (the default
  is the path returned by <span class="shell">`which rspec`</span> or <span class="shell">`which spec`</span>, depending
  on which one doesn&#8217;t return an error. You can also choose the options to pass
  to RSpec and whether to include full backtraces (which is the same as passing
  the <code>-b</code> options to RSpec). This option should be enabled if using RSpec 1,
  while it should remain disabled with RSpec 2.</dd>
	<dt>Spec Files</dt>
	<dd>here you can choose the directories containing the example files,
  the directory containing the code files and a filter to distinguish spec
  files from other files (for example, helper files) in the spec directories. The
  filter is simply a shell pattern and should only take into account the name of
  the file, not the full path. The spec and code directories don&#8217;t need to include
  only specs and code files, respectively. For example, they can both be set to
  the project&#8217;s toplevel directory. What is important is that the spec directory
  contains all specs files and that the code directory contains all code files
  (of course, code and spec files can be in subdirectories).</dd>
	<dt>Patterns</dt>
	<dd>here you associated code files with the corresponding spec files.
  By default, any file with extension <code>.rb</code> is associated with a spec file having
  the same name with a <code>_spec.rb</code> appended to it. If you want to add a new pattern,
  use the <code>Add Pattern</code> button. It will insert a new entry in the list. Double
  click on it to change it. In the <code>Spec file</code> column, you can use several special
  sequences:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
	<li><code>%f</code>: this is replaced with the name of the code file (without its path and
    the <code>.rb</code> extension)</li>
	<li><code>%d</code>: this is replaced with the directory of the code file (relative to the
    project directory)</li>
	<li><code>%d</code><em>n</em>: here <em>n</em> can be any number. This is replaced by the _n_th part of the
    code file directory (relative to the project directory). For example, the special
    sequence <code>%d2</code> when applied to a file named <code>a/b/c/e/f/d.rb</code> will become <code>b</code>
    (note that path parts are counted from 1, not from 0).</li>
</ul>
<p>The RSpec plugin adds a <code>Tests</code> submenu to the <code>Ruby</code> menu. It contains several entries:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Switch to Spec/Switch to Code</dt>
	<dd>the name of this entry is different depending
  on whether the current file is a code file (then the name will be <code>Switch to Spec</code>
  or a spec file (<code>Switch to Code</code>). In the first case, it will display one of the
  spec files associated with the current document; in the second case it will display
  the code file associated with the current document</dd>
	<dt>Run Project Specs</dt>
	<dd>runs all the spec files associated with the
  current project, displaying the result in the tool widget</dd>
	<dt>Run Specs for Current File</dt>
	<dd>if the current file is a spec file, that file is
  run. If the current file is a code file, all spec files associated with it are
  run</dd>
	<dt>Run Current Spec</dt>
	<dd>if the current file is a spec file, RSpec is run on the line
  where the cursor is (using the <code>-l</code> argument of <code>rspec/spec</code>). If the current
  file is a code file, instead, the plugin looks for open spec files associated
  with the current file. If it finds them, it looks for the one which was activated
  last and looks RSpec on it, on the line where the cursor was. If no spec file
  is open, nothing is done</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the RSpec page of the Ruber configuration dialog you can change two behaviour
of the plugin:</p>
<ul>
	<li>you can decide whether the editor for the file opened by the <code>Switch to Spec</code>
  menu entry will be opened in a new tab or by splitting the current editor (so
  that you can have the spec and code file side to side)</li>
	<li>you can decide whether or not to expand the entries corresponding to failed
  examples in the tool widget. You can choose between to expand no entry, only
  the first one or all of them (the latter could be slow if there are many failed
  examples)</li>
</ul>
<p>From the RSpec page of the project configuration dialog, you can change several
other parameters: the options to pass ruby when running rspec, the path of the
RSpec executable to use, options to be passed to RSpec and whether to instruct
RSpec to generate full backtraces (which is the same as passing the <code>-b</code> option
to RSpec).</p>
<h3 id="ruby-development">Ruby Development</h3>
<p>The Ruby Development plugin allows you to run the program associated to your project,
the file corresponding to the current document or any other file from within
Ruber and to display the output in a tool widget.</p>
<p>The <code>Ruby/Run Current File</code> menu entry will run the file associated to the current document
in ruby, while the <code>Ruby/Run Current File</code> will show a dialog where you can choose
the file to run.</p>
<p>The <code>Ruby/Run</code> menu entry will work as <code>Run Current File</code> if there&#8217;s no open project
and there&#8217;s an open ruby file and as <code>Run File</code> if there is neither an open project
nor an open file. If there&#8217;s an open project, instead, it will run the script
associated with the project. By default, it&#8217;s a file with the same name as the
project and located in the <code>bin</code> subdirectory of the project directory. You can
change it In the ruby page of the project configuration dialog by entering another
file name in the Path line edit.</p>
<p>This plugin also allows to run scripts in a terminal, rather than in Ruber. This
is mostly useful for scripts which read from standard input, as it (currently)
can&#8217;t be done from within Ruber. You can enable this by checking the
<code>Ruby/Run Programs in Terminal</code> menu entry or through the project or document
configuration dialog. The default application is <code>Konsole</code>, which is included in
<span class="caps">KDE</span>. If you want, however, you can configure the plugin to use a different terminal
emulator (see below for details).</p>
<p>There are several global settings for this plugin, which you can change in the
Ruby page of the Ruber configuration dialog. They are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the list of availlable ruby interpreters. By default this plugin looks for programs
  called <code>ruby</code>, <code>ruby19</code>, <code>ruby18</code>, <code>ruby1.9</code> and <code>ruby1.8</code> in your <span class="caps">PATH</span> (using
  the <code>which</code> program). To add other interpreters, remove the ones you don&#8217;t want
  to see listed or change the order, use the Availlable interpreters widget</li>
	<li>the default ruby interpreter to use. Among the interpreters listed in the
  Availlable Interpreters widget, you can choose which one to use by default by
  setting it in the Default Interpreter widget</li>
	<li>the default options to pass to ruby. Set them in the Ruby options widget</li>
	<li>the terminal emulator program to use. Write the command line to use in the Terminal
  line editor. There are two special placeholders recognized: <code>%d</code>, which means the
  directory where the terminal emulator should be open into and <code>%r</code> which indicates
  where the ruby command line should be put. This placeholder must either be enclosed
  in spaces or be at the end of the line and preceded by a space. Note that command
  line arguments can&#8217;t contain spaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some parameters used by this plugin can also be configured on a per project base
from the Ruby page of the project configuration dialog. They are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the path of the project script (as described above)</li>
	<li>the options to pass to the project script</li>
	<li>the working directory of the project script (which defaults to the project directory)</li>
	<li>whether the project script should be run from a terminal or not</li>
	<li>the ruby interpreter to use (overrides the global setting)</li>
	<li>the options to pass to the ruby interpreter (overrides the global setting)</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the above options can also be set on a per document base (except, of course,
for the project script and the working directory).</p>
<p>The ruby interpreter to use can also be changed temporarily by selecting another
interpreter from the <code>Ruby/Ruby Interpreter</code> menu. This overrides both the global
setting and the setting for the current document or project.</p>
<h3 id="ruby-syntax-checker">Ruby syntax checker</h3>
<p>This plugin provides a syntax checker for ruby files to be used with the <a href="#syntax-checker">Syntax Checker</a>
plugin.</p>
<p>The syntax check is performed using <code>ruby -c</code>. The ruby interpreter is obtained
from the <a href="#ruby-development">ruby development</a> plugin.</p>
<h3 id="state">State</h3>
<p>The State plugin allows to save the state of Ruber, of each project and each document
between sessions, so that it can be restored when Ruber, the project, or the file
is next reopened.</p>
<p>By <i>state</i>, this plugin mean:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>for Ruber</dt>
	<dd>the list of open projects and editors not associated with any project</dd>
	<dt>for a project</dt>
	<dd>the list of editors associated with to the project</dd>
	<dt>for a file</dt>
	<dd>the cursor position in the file.</dd>
</dl>
<p>As a user, you don&#8217;t interact with this plugin, except to configure its behaviour
in the Ruber configuration dialog. The options you can change are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>when opening a document, whether to move the cursor to the position it was when
  the document was last closed</li>
	<li>what to do when Ruber starts up. You can decide to:
	<ul>
		<li>Restore all the open projects and editors</li>
		<li>Restore all projects, but not editors not associated with any projects</li>
		<li>Restore editors not associated with any projects, but not open projects</li>
		<li>Keep the default workspace</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>When restoring sessions, editors associated with an unsaved files will become empty.</p>
<h3 id="syntax-checker">Syntax Checker</h3>
<p>The sytnax checker plugin allows to check the syntax of a file, according to some
kind of rule.</p>
<p>This plugin knows no syntax rules, so it can&#8217;t perform syntax checks by itself. It
needs to have syntax checkers installed for each kind of file you want the check
to be done. For example, Ruber comes with a syntax checker for <a href="#ruby-syntax-checker">ruby files</a>
and for <a href="#yaml-syntax-checker"><span class="caps">YAML</span> files</a>. Each syntax checker has its own ways
to check syntax and the quality of the error reports may be different from one checker
to the next.</p>
<p>The syntax checker to use for each document is determined according to the file extension,
which means that it will only work if the document has been saved to file (note
that the file is only used to determine the checker to use: the contents will be
those displayed in the editor, even if they haven&#8217;t been saved).</p>
<p>The syntax check is done every time the file is saved and after a pause of at least
1 second while editing the document (that is, if you don&#8217;t change the text for at
least one second). You can disable this automatic checking from the Ruber configuration
dialog in the Syntax page.</p>
<p>The result of the last syntax check is shown in a <span class="caps">LED</span> widget at the right
end of the status bar: if it&#8217;s green, then there aren&#8217;t syntax errors; if it&#8217;s red,
there are syntax errors. Finally, if it&#8217;s gray it means that no syntax check has
been done, either because the document isn&#8217;t associated with a <span class="caps">YAML</span> or ruby file
or because the conditions for the check haven&#8217;t already happened.</p>
<p>In case of syntax errors, hovering with the mouse over the <span class="caps">LED</span> will display a tool
tip with the error message of the first error; left-clicking on the <span class="caps">LED</span> will move
the cursor to the corresponding line. Right-clicking on the <span class="caps">LED</span> will display a
menu listing all the errors: clicking on an item in the menu moves the cursor to
the position of the corresponding error.</p>
<h3 id="yaml-syntax-checker"><span class="caps">YAML</span> syntax checker</h3>
<p>This plugin provides a syntax checker for <span class="caps">YAML</span> files to be used with the <a href="#syntax-checker">Syntax Checker</a>
plugin.</p>
<p>The syntax check is performed using by loading the file using <code>YAML.load</code> and
seeing whether or not it raises exceptions. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not possible to
report specific information on the kind of error, as <code>YAML.load</code> doesn&#8217;t provide
any.</p>
<div class="rule" style="padding-top:1px">
<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> Actually, there&#8217;s another plugin, called Ruby Runner which comes with Ruber.
However, this plugin is mostly of support for other plugins. The settings it
provides it described together with the <a href="#ruby-development">Ruby development</a> plugin.
