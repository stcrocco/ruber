<h3 id="Ruber-0-0-10-released-2011-10-21">Ruber 0.0.10 released</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom:10px;font-size:1.2em;color:#FF7E80x;"><strong>2011-10-21</strong></p>
<p>A new release which includes two new plugins and significant improvements to
the RSpec and Auto End plugins.</p>
<h4>Changes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Added a RI plugin. You can now insert the class or method name in the RI tool widget
   and see the documentation in a nice <span class="caps">HTML</span> format inside the tool widget itself.
   This plugin requires RDoc version 3.x (it isn&#8217;t tested with version 2.x).</li>
	<li>Added an <span class="caps">IRB</span> plugin</li>
	<li>The syntax checker plugin has been rewritten. Now other plugins can check the
   syntax of a document</li>
	<li>Ruby and <span class="caps">YAML</span> syntax checker now are in their own plugin, rather than being part
   of the syntax checker plugin</li>
	<li>The auto end plugin doesn&#8217;t use indentation anymore to decide whether the end keyword
   should be inserted or not. Instead, it performs a syntax check and only inserts
   end if ruby reports a missing end keyword. This should improve the accuracy of
   the plugin</li>
	<li>The Auto End plugin now inserts the <code>end</code> keyword after a <code>case</code> expression</li>
	<li>Clicking on a file name in an output widget with the middle mouse button now
   prevents the tool widget from being hidden, as if the pin button were clicked</li>
	<li>Changed the interface to specify patterns in the RSpec plugin</li>
	<li>The RSpec plugin now supports specs inside subdirectories. You can also specify
   subdirectories inside the pattern to match code file and the respective spec
   file</li>
	<li>When choosing the Run Specs for Current File action in the RSpec plugin, if the current
   document is associated with a code file, all the specs associated with it are
   run (previously, only one of them was run)</li>
	<li>When choosing the Run Current Spec action in the RSpec plugin, if the current
   document is a code file, the plugin will look at the most recently activated
   editor containing a spec file for the current file to determine which is the
   current spec.</li>
	<li>The behaviour of output widgets when clicking on a file name which requires
   opening a new editor has changed. The choice made by the user to open the editor
   in the current tab by splitting the current editor is ignored if the current 
   tab already contains more than one editor. The reason is that usually there
   won&#8217;t be enough space on the sceen to comfortably accomodate more than two
   editors.
</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="rule" style="padding-top:10px" >
<h3 id="Ruber-0-0-9-released-2011-05-30">Ruber 0.0.9 released</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom:10px;font-size:1.2em;color:#FF7E80x;"><strong>2011-05-30</strong></p>
<p>Another much delayed release. With only three new features and a copule of fixed
bugs, the changelog is quite short, but implementing two of the new features
required a complete rewriting of some of the Ruber internals, which took a long
time.</p>
<h4>Changes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>It is now possible to have more than one open project at the same time</li>
	<li>When a project is active, only the editors associated with it are visibile</li>
	<li>Editors not associated with a project are visible only when there&#8217;s no active
  project</li>
	<li>Made the Auto End plugin recognize some other keywords: <code>unless</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>,
<code>until</code> (the last two were already recognized when followed by a <code>do</code>)</li>
	<li>The RSpec plugin now correctly displays pending examples</li>
	<li>Fixed a crash when creating a new document and saving it as a ruby file while
  using the Syntax Checker plugin
</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="rule" style="padding-top:10px" >
<h3 id="Ruber-0-0-8-released-2011-02-07">Ruber 0.0.8 released</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom:10px;font-size:1.2em;color:#FF7E80x;"><strong>2011-02-07</strong></p>
<p>This release brings a number of new features (and some minor bug fixes).</p>
<h4>Changes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Added a new plugin: Auto End, which automatically inserts <code>end</code>
  keywords after <code>module</code>, <code>class</code>, <code>if</code>&#8230;</li>
	<li>Added a button to prevent clicking on a file in a tool widget to close it
  while opening the file (replaces the use of the Meta key for the same scope)</li>
	<li>Allow to open a new editor when clicking on a file name in a tool widget with
  the Meta key pressed</li>
	<li>Added horizontal scrollbars to the RSpec tool widget</li>
	<li>Unified Replaced Switch to File and Switch to Spec menu entries in the Ruby/Test menu</li>
	<li>Added an option to have the Switch to Spec|Code menu entry create the editor
  in the current tab (by splitting the current editor), so you can have code
  and spec side by side (mostly useful for people with widescreens)</li>
	<li>The Command plugin is now able to show output sent to standard output and
  standard error</li>
	<li>Added menu entries (with the corresponding shortcuts) to move between split views
  in the current pane</li>
	<li>Disabled autoscrolling in tool widgets if the scroll bar is not at the end
</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="rule" style="padding-top:10px" >
<h3 id="Ruber-0-0-7-released-2011-01-12">Ruber 0.0.7 released</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom:10px;font-size:1.2em;color:#FF7E80x;"><strong>2011-01-12</strong></p>
<p>This is a much delayed release, as it should have happened at least one month
ago. It brings one significant new feature: split views. Now you can have more
than one view in each tab, and also more than one view for each document!</p>
<p>Note that the git tag for this release is 0.0.7-r1.</p>
<h4>Changes:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>more than one view for a single document now allowed</li>
	<li>more than one view in a single tab</li>
	<li>optional close buttons on tabs</li>
	<li>made the terminal program configurable. Now you don&#8217;t need to have Konsole
  installed to run a script in a terminal.
</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="rule" style="padding-top:10px" >
<h3 id="Ruber-0-0-6-released-2010-11-14">Ruber 0.0.6 released</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom:10px;font-size:1.2em;color:#FF7E80x;"><strong>2010-11-14</strong></p>
<p>After three extremely small releases (let&#8217;s say emergency releases), at last
here&#8217;s a version with some improvements.</p>
<h4>Changes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>some bugs fixed</li>
	<li>ability to work with remote files. The RSpec and Rake plugin don&#8217;t work with
  remote files (I don&#8217;t think it makes sense to do otherwise), but you can run
  them in ruby.
</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="rule" style="padding-top:10px" >
<h3 id="Ruber-0-0-5-released-2010-11-03">Ruber 0.0.5 released</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom:10px;font-size:1.2em;color:#FF7E80x;"><strong>2010-11-03</strong></p>
<p>Another very small, bugfix release. It fixes a bug which caused a crash when
attempting to open a file</p>
</div>
<div class="rule" style="padding-top:10px" >
<h3 id="Ruber-0-0-4-released-2010-11-03">Ruber 0.0.4 released</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom:10px;font-size:1.2em;color:#FF7E80x;"><strong>2010-11-03</strong></p>
<p>With the 0.0.3 version skipped for technical reasons, this release brings two
bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a bug which caused a crash if a directory was missing</li>
	<li>a bug preventing new files from being created
</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="rule" style="padding-top:10px" >
<h3 id="Ruber-0-0-2-released-2010-11-03">Ruber 0.0.2 released</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom:10px;font-size:1.2em;color:#FF7E80x;"><strong>2010-11-03</strong></p>
<p>This version contains a single, even if important, change. It fixes a bug
which made it impossible to start Ruber. The reason was that Ruber tried to
access a directory it should create itself at a later point. Since the directory
doesn&#8217;t exist, Ruber crashes.</p>
</div>
<div class="rule" style="padding-top:10px" >
<h3 id="Ruber-0-0-1-released-2010-10-29">Ruber 0.0.1 released</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom:10px;font-size:1.2em;color:#FF7E80x;"><strong>2010-10-29</strong></p>
<p>First public version of Ruber released today. It&#8217;s still alpha-quality
and contains several bugs (most of them, unfortunately, appearing randomly
and so quite difficult to fix). However, most of the bugs do not cause loss
of data (at least if you enable autosaving), so you can try it.</p>
